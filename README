/* Connect Four in Ruby */

For spring break 2016, I am learning ruby by making this game

Code will likely start sloppy, but plenty of opportunity for refactoring
down the road.

At some point I'd like to use some gui with it to move it out of the 
command line

To-do:
  - handle errors, like out-of-bound indecies
  - modularize better, move to other files ideally
  - display winning message with player number
  - handle cats games
  - increase dimensions
  - consider using a graphics package to make it look good (shoes?)
